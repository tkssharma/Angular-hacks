  "description": "Typescript is a suberset of javascript. At first may not look like much. Why not just use es2015 or remain on es5? The matter of the fact is that there are many interesting features with it that will make your old angular 1 projects more manageable and bring structure to your angular 2 apps. So lets look at its features but also how it can help you right here and now and bring order in the es5 chaos. Hopefully you will leave this talk inspired to give your legacy projects the love and care it deserves, but also look forward to the future that is angular2."
