  "description": "Redux is a library that helps manage the state of your application using a flux-inspired unidirectional data flow. In this talk, we will be providing a brief overview of the core concepts of Redux, the benefits of a global immutable application state, and then explore some of the best practices, and common pitfalls of using Redux with Angular 2. Using ng2-redux to provide Angular 2 bindings, we will explore how to access your Angular 2 services in your actions and middleware, effective use of Observables and RxJs with Redux, and how to use TypeScript for creating typed actions and reducers."
